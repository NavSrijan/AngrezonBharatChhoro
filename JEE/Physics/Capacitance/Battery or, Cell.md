# Cell 
- Is a device that sores chemical energy and converts it into electrical energy.
- Is a two terminal device.
- Some potential difference is maintained between the terminals of the cell by means of chemical reactions. This is called **EMF (electromotive force)**.
- ==+ve== --> Terminal which is at higher potential.
- ==-ve== --> Terminal which is at lower potential.

- The symbol indicated above is for an ideal cell.
- All real cell always have some resistance in them. This is called _internal resistance_ of the cell. The symbol for that cell is:

- Whenever +q charges moves through the cell from -ve end towards +ve end, $q \Delta V$ amount of chemical energy gets converted into electrical energy. (_Discharging of cell_)
- Hence, work done by the batter $= q \Delta V$
- $$\boxed{W_{b}=q \Delta V}$$
- Whenever +q charges moves through the cell from +ve end towards -ve end, $q \Delta V$ amount of chemical energy gets stored in the battery. (_Charging of cell_)
- $$\boxed{W_{charging}=q \Delta V}$$
