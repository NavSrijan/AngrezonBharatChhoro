```ad-note 
title:Defn
When capacitors are in series then **charge flown ghrough all the capacitors will be same,** but potential drop will be differnt across all the capacitors.

$$\boxed{\frac{1}{C_{s}}=\frac{1}{C_{1}}+\frac{1}{C_{2}}+....+\frac{1}{C_n}}$$
> Equivalent capacitance is smaller than the smallest value of capacitor used.
