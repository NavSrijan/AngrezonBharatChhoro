title:Note 
In parallel plate capacitor energy is confined between capacitor plates.
```

**Capacitance** of a **parallel plate capacitor** with plate area A and plate separation d:
$$\boxed{C=\frac{A \epsilon_{0}}{d}}$$
**Net electric field** between the plates 
$$\boxed{E_{net}=\frac{\sigma}{\epsilon_{0}}=\frac{Q}{A \epsilon_{0}}=\frac{\Delta V}{d}}$$

## Force between the plates of capacitor
$$\text{Force on right place} = \text{(E.F due to the plate)}\times \text{(Total charge on right plate)}$$
$F=E.q$
$F=\frac{\sigma}{2 \epsilon_{0}}\times \sigma A$
$F=\frac{\sigma^{2}A}{2 \epsilon_{0}}=\frac{Q^{2}}{A^{2}}\times \frac{A}{2 \epsilon_{0}}$
$$\boxed{F=\frac{Q^{2}}{2A \epsilon_{0}}}$$

### Series case

## System of parallel plates 
- Create team A and team B.
- Plates connected to A will come under A and connected to B will come under B.
- Create capacitors between two plates from opposite teams. 
- Plates from same team can't create capacitors.

- For example, here $C_{1}$ will be formed due to 1 and 2, since they belong to two different teams.

- This is how the simplified circuit will look.
