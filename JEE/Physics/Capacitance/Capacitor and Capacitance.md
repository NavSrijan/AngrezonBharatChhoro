# Capacitor
Capacitor is a device used to store electrical energy. It provides instantaneous energy.
- Every capacitor will have two difference surfaces (Plates).
# Capacitance 
$Q \propto V$
$$\boxed{Q=CV}$$
**This proportionality is known as capacitance.**
```ad-note 
title:Capacitance 
Capacitance of a body denotes its ability to store charge.
"_The capacitanece of a body is numerically equal to the charge required to increase its potential by 1 volt._"

**SI unit**: farad(F)
==Scalar==
