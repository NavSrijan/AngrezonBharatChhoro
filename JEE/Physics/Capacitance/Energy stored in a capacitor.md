- A capacitor stores energy in the form of [[Electric Field]] .
- [[Work]] must be done by an external agent (_battery_) to charge a capacitor.
```ad-note 
title:Note 
Battery doesn't provide charge to a system, it only makes the charge travel in the system.
```

$dW=\text{Work done by external agent to bring charge dq}$
$dW=V\,dq=\frac{q}{C}dq$ $(\because q=CV)$

Total work done by external agent to completely charge the capacitor.
$=\int dW=\int \frac{qdq}{C}=\frac{1}{C}\int_{0}^{Q}qdq$
$=\frac{1}{C}(\frac{q^{2}}{2})_{0}^{Q}$
$$\boxed{U=\frac{Q^{2}}{2C}=\frac{(CV)^{2}}{2C}=\frac{1}{2}CV^{2}}$$
where,
$Q=\text{Charge on the capacitor}$
$C=\text{Capacitance}$
$V=\text{Potential of the capacitor w.r.t reference point}$
