# Work-Energy Theorem
This theorem relates [[JEE/Physics/Work, Power & Energy/Work]] and [[JEE/Physics/Work, Power & Energy/Kinetic Energy]]. It states that work done by all the forces ([[JEE/Physics/Conservative Force]], [[JEE/Physics/Non-Conservative Force]], external, etc.) acting on a body is equal to change in its kinetic energy.

$$\Delta K.E. = W_{conservative}+W_{non-conservatice}+W_{external}$$
According to ![[JEE/Physics/Conservative Force#^e0e750]]
$$\Delta K.E. = -\Delta U + W_{NC} + W_{ext}$$
$$\Delta K.E. + \Delta U = W_{NC} + W_{ext}$$
