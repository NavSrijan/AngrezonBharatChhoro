# Flux ($\phi$)
```ad-note 
title:Flux 
It is generally defined as number of something, crossing a surface.
```
- It is the measure of number of electric field lines passing through any surface.
- ==Scalar Quantity==
- SI unit: **V.M** Volt meters.

### What does flux depend upon?
![[Electric Flux 2022-05-05 13.27.54.excalidraw]]
#### [[Electric Field]] 
```mermaid
graph TD

A[If electric field is strong] -->B[Density of electric field lines is higher]

B --> C[Greater number of field lines pass through the surface]

C-->D[Greater flux passes through surface]
```
$$\boxed{\phi \propto E}$$
#### Surface Area 
```mermaid
graph TD

A[If the surface area is small] -->B[Number of field lines passing through is less]

B --> C[Flux passing through is small]

```
$$\boxed{\phi \propto A}$$
#### Angle b/w electric field and area of surface 
```mermaid
graph TD

A[Angle between field and the area decreases] -->B[Fewer elctric field lines pass through surface]

B --> C[But when surface and field lines are perpendicular to each other]

C-->D[Greater flux passes through surface]
```
$$\boxed{\phi \propto \theta}$$
