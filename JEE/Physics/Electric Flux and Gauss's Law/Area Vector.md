## Area 
- It is a vector quantity.
- Direction of area vector is always perpendicular to the surface.
- For open surfaces (square plate, triangular plate etc.)
consider once perpendicular direction as area vector
direction.
- For closed surfaces (sphere, cube etc.) consider outward
normal as area vector direction.
