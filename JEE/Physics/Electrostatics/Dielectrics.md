Dielectrics are **non-counducting** substances. They are the insulating materials and are bad conductors of electric current. Dielectric materials can hold an electrostatic charge while dissipating minimal energy in the form of heat.
Ex: Mica, Plastics, Glass, Porcelain, Paper and various **Metal Oxides**.

## Behaviour of NON POLAR dielectric material 
A **neutral nonpolar atom** - Nucleus surrounded by the electron cloud.

On application of external E, the electron cloud ad the nucleus shifts to create non-zero dipole moment (i.e. **polarization**).

## Behaviour of POLAR dielectric material 
Dipoles are randomly oriented in the absence of external [[Electric Field]].

On application of **external E**, dipoles are acted upon by torque and they tend to orient themselves along the direction of external E.

This helps in explaining 3 phenomenon:

### Polarization 
Equal and opposite charges appear on the edges of the dielectric. Situation is similar to induction but with difference that it is **much milder than induction**.

### Reduction of filed due to presence of a medium 
The **net electric field is a little less** in presence of dielectric medium as compared to case of its absence.
$E_{net}=E-E_{in}$

### Dielectric Breakdown 
The dipole is under tension due to electric field. The value of external field at which the dipole splits into separate monopoles is called the **Dielectric Strength** of the medium and the process is called Dielectric breakdown.

> After breakdown, **dielectric medium** acquires conducting property temporarily.
