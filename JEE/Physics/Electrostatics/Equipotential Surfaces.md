# Equipotential Surfaces
The surface on which each point has equal potential.
- If electric field lines are perpendicular to the surface, potential of all the points will be same.

- Since, electric field is always perpendicular to an equipotential surface, work done in moving a charge between two points on an equipotential surface is zero.

## Work done by Electrostatic field 
### Case 1: When charge is moved between two equipotential surfaces.
Work done by external agent-
$$\boxed{W=\Delta Vq}$$

### Case 2: When charge is moved within a equipotential surface
For an equipotential surface, $\Delta V=0$
$$\boxed{W_{ext.}=0}$$

## For a point charge:
In case of point charge, equipotential surfaces are concentric spherical shells.

## Notes:
For a uniform [[Electric Field]], Equipotential surfaces are planes perpendicular to [[Electric Field]] lines.
