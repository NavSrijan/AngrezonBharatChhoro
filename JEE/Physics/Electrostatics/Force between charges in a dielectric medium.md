# Force b/w charges in a [[Dielectrics| Dielectric]] medium 
If the space between the charges is filled with a non conducting medium or an insulator called "[[Dielectrics|dielectric]]", it is found that the dielectric reduces the electrostatic force as compared to free space by a factor ($\epsilon_{r}$) called **DIELECTRIC CONSTANT**.

It is denoted by $$\boxed{\epsilon_{r}\text{ or, }k}$$
This factor is also known as **relative permittivity**.
$\epsilon=\epsilon_{o}\epsilon_{r}$
$$\boxed{\epsilon_{r}=\frac{\epsilon}{\epsilon_{o}}}$$
$K_{vaccum}=1$
$K_{metals}\rightarrow \infty$
