# Relations 
Any subset of $A\times B$ is defined as a relation from set A to set B, where A and B are non-empty sets.
$$\therefore A\times B = \{(a,b)| a\epsilon A\,\, and \,\,b \epsilon B\}$$
Number of elements in set A, $n(A) = p$
Number of elements in set B, $n(B)=q$

Number of relations $= 2^{pq}$

```ad-note 
title:Info 
Relation from A to A is also called **relation on A**.
```

## Inverse of Relations
If R is a relation on set A, then the relation $R^{-1}$ on A, is defined by
$$\boxed{R^{-1}=\{(b,a):(a,b)\epsilon R\}}$$
Domain $(R^{-1})=\text{Range of } (R)$
Range $(R^{-1})=\text{Domain of } (R)$

Example:
$R=\{(a,1),(b,2),(c,3),(d,4)\}$
$R^{-1}={(1,a),(2,b),(3,c),(4,d)}$
