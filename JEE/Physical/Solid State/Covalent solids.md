title: Graphite's exception
Graphite is an exception of covalent or network solid.
- Exceptional properties is due to its typical structure.
- Carbon atoms are arranged in different layers.
- Each Cis bonded to 3 C.
- The fourth valence electron of each atom is free to move between layers.
- These free electrons make graphite a good conductor of elctricity.
- Due to layered structure graphie is soft solid and a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">good solid lubricant.</mark>
