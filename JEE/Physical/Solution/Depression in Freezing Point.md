# Depression in freezing point
> The freezing point of a substance may be defined as the temperature at which the [[Vapour Pressure]] of the substance in its liquid phase is equal to its [[Vapour Pressure]] in the solid phase.

The decrease in freezing point of solvent on addition of non-volative solute is known as _depression in freezing point_( $\Delta T_{f}$ )
$$\Delta T_{f}=T_{f}^{o}-T_{f}$$
$$\Delta T_{f}\propto \text{Molality}$$
$$\boxed{\Delta T_{f}=K_{f}m}$$
where,
$K_{f} =$ **Freezing point Depression constant** or **Molal Depression constant** or **Cryoscopic constant**
==Units== of $K_{f} = K \,kg\, mol^{-1}$ 
For water, $K_{f}=1.86 K \,kg\, mol^{-1}$

$$\boxed{\Delta T_{f}=K_{f}\times \frac{w_{2}\times 1000}{M_{2}\times w_{1}}}$$
where,
$w_{2}=$ Mass of non-volatile solute,
$M_{2}=$ Molar mass of non-volatile solute,
$w_{1}=$ Mass of the solvent 

**The values of $K_{f}$ depend upon the nature of the solvent.

### Determination of $K_f$
$$\boxed{K_{f}=\frac{R \times M_{1}\times T_{f}^{o\,2}}{1000 \times \Delta_{fus}H}}$$
where,
$M_{1}=$ Molar mass of the solvent
$T_{f}^{o}=$ Freezing point of pure solvent (in K)
$\Delta_{fus}H$ Enthalpy of fusion of solvent
$$\boxed{=\frac{R \times T_{f}^{o/,2}}{1000 \times L}}$$
where,
L = Latent heat of fusion
