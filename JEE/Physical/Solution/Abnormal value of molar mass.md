title:Definition 
A molar mass tha tis either lower or higher than the expected or normal value is called as **abnormal molar mass**.

```
- In 1880 _van't Hoff_ introduced a factor _i_, known as the _van't hoff factor_, to account for the extent of dissociation or association.
$$\boxed{i=\frac{\text{Observed value of colligative property}}{\text{Theoretical value of colligative property}}}$$
$$\boxed{i=\frac{\text{Observed no.  of particles/concentration}}{\text{Theoretical no. of particles}}}$$
$$\boxed{i=\frac{\text{Theoretical mass of substance}}{\text{Experminetal molar mass of substance}}}$$
$$\boxed{\boxed{\boxed{\boxed{i>1 \text{ dissociation, }i<1 \text{ associaton }}}}}$$

title:Note 
- In case of dissociating solutes, **abnormal molar mass < actual molar mass**.
- In case of associating solutes, **abnormal molar mass > actual molar mass**.
