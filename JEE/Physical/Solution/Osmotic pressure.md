title:Semipermeable membrane 

- These membranes contain a network of submicroscopic holes or pores.
- Small solvent molecules, like water, can pass through these holes but the passage of bigger molecules like solute is hindered.
- Examples -
	- Natural: pig's bladder or parchment
	- Synthetic: cellophane

title:Osmosis
- If a SPM(Semi permeable membrane) is placed between the solvent and solution, the solvent molecules will flow through the membrane from pure solvent to the solution.

- This process of flow of the solvent is called osmosis.

- Solvent _molecules always flow from **lower concentration to higher
concentration of solution.**

>The osmotic pressure of a solution is the excess pressure that must be applied to a solution to prevent osmosis, i.e., to stop the passage of solvent molecules through a semipermeable membrane into the solution.

- The flow continues til the equilibrium is atained.
- Extra pressure developed at equilibrium on the solution side that just stops the flow of solvent is called _osmotic pressure of the solution._
- If we externally apply pressure equal to osmotic pressure on the solution side initially, then the flow of solvent from SPM will not take place at all.

##### For dilute solutions,
$$\boxed{\Pi=CRT}$$ ($\Pi=\text{Osmotic pressure}$)
If $n_{2}$ moles of solute are dissolved in "V" L of solvent, then 
$$\Pi=(\frac{n_2}{V})RT$$
$$\boxed{\Pi \,V=n_{2}RT}$$
Can be rearranged to get molar mass,
$$\boxed{M_2=\frac{w_{2}RT}{\Pi \,V}}$$
## Isotonic, hypertonic and hypotonic [[Solutions]] 
### Isotonic 
Two solutions having same osmotic pressure at a given temperature are called **isotonic solutions**.
- No osmosis occurs between them.
- Examples.... 
- Fluid in blood cell has concentration equivalent to 0.9% (w/v) NaCl.
	- It will cause no shrinking/swelling of blood cells and is safe to inject.

```ad-note 
title:Hyper and Hypo 
- If $\Pi_1>\Pi_2$
	- Solution 1 --> **Hypertonic** 
	- Solution 2 --> **Hypotonic** 

- If we place blood cells in hypotonic solution...
	- Water will flow into the cells if placed in this solution and they would swell.
- If we place blood cells in hypertonic solution...
	- Water will flow out of the cells and they would shrink.

## Applications of osmosis 
- Raw mango pickling process.
- Wilted flowers revive when placed in freshwater.
- Preservation of meat by salting and of fruits by adding sugar.
- People who have high salt intake, experience water retention in tissue cells and intercellular spaces. The resulting puffiness or swelling is called **edema**.
- Water movement from soil into plant roots and subsequently into upper portion of the plant is partly due to osmosis.
