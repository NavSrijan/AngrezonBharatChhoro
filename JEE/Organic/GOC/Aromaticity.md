```ad-note 
title:Aromatic 
The term **Aromatic** originated from **Aroma** as aromacitc compounds generally have a plesant smell.
```
### Aromatic
Aromatic compound follows **Huckel's rule**:
-  Presence of <mark class="hltr-yellow">(4n + 2)$\pi e^-$</mark> in the ring. Where, (n=0,1,2,3â€¦)
- Conjugated system (de-localisation of $\pi e^-$ in ring)
 - Cyclic
- Planarity (2-D) ($sp^2$ carbon)

### Non-aromatic, anti-aromatic, aromatic
- Cyclic, planar conjugate system having <mark class="hltr-yellow">(4n)$\pi e^{-}$</mark> are extra unstable, called
**anti-aromatic** species.
- One which is neither aromatic nor anti-aromatic is called **non-aromatic**.
For example - cyclohexene
- **Stability** : Aromatic > Non-aromatic > Anti-aromatic

### Application of Aromaticity
- $sp^{3}$ carbon in first reaction is highly acidic as its anion (Conjugate base)
is aromatic in nature.

- C-C bond order between two rings is expected to be 2, but it is actually
1 because of aromaticity.
- Such compound has high dipole moment because of aromaticity.
