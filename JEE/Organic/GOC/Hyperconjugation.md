# Hyperconjugation effect
- The complete delocalization of a sigma C-H/D/T bond of $sp^{3}$ hybridised carbon into vacant p-orbital of adjacent $sp^{2}$ hybridised carbon is called hyperconjugation.
- Also called $\sigma ,\pi$ conjugation, **Baker - Nathan effect**/**No bond resonance**
- Permanent polarisation caused by interaction of $\pi$ M.O with Câ€”H bond in conjugation.
- Stabilising effect.
- Does not depend upon distance.
- Applicable for carbocation, free radical & $\pi$ bond with $\alpha$-H: (Hydrogen on $sp^{3}$ hybridised $\alpha$-C)
- Similar to resonance effect, hyperconjugation also affects only o, p positions and do not affect meta position.

## Condition for +H effect
- Presence of $\alpha-H$ or D or T
- Bond strength $\alpha-H<\alpha-D<\alpha-T$
