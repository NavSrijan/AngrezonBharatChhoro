# Carbocations
- Carbon atom has positive charge and 6 electrons in its valence shell.
- Electron deficient specics, formed by heterolytic fission.

## Stability of carbocation
Since carbocation is electron deficient species so EDG stabilises carbocation.
- +l effect $\propto$ stability of carbocation
 - [[Hyperconjugation]] effect (More $\alpha$-H more will be the stability)
-  Resonance effect(+M) $\propto$ stability of carbocation
