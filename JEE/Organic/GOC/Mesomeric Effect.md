# Mesomeric Effect 
- **Permanent effect**, where the displacement of conjugated $\pi e^{-}$s is
influenced by the group attached to carbon chain.
- **Stabilizing effect**, operates only in conjugated systems.
- **Does not depend upon distance**. Runs from one end to the other of
conjugation.
- It is a complete push or pull (shift) of $\pi e^{-}$ of the conjugated system of
molecule.
- **M-effect has no correlation with the electronegativity** of the connecting
atom of the group.

## +M Effect 
- Effect in which a group pushes the electrons into the conjugated system is +M effect and these groups are **+M groups**.
- EDG group in conjugation is known as **activating group**.
- Examples: Halogens $-OH, -OR, -OCOR, -NH_{2}, -NHCOR$ etc.
#### Condition
- Lone pair on first atom of the group.

- R/+M groups are **ortho** and **para** directing with respect to benzene.
#### Relative order of +M group

### -M Effect 
- Effect in which a group pulled the $\pi e^{-}$ electrons from the conjugated system,
is -M effect and these groups are -M groups.
- EWG group in conjugation is known as **deactivating group**.
- Examples: $-COOH, -COOR, -CHO, -CN, -NO_2$ etc.
#### Condition:
- Vacant orbital on first atom or Multiple bond with more E.N. second atom.

- R/-M groups are meta directing with respect to benzene.
#### Relative order of -M group:

## Application of Mesomeric Effect
- Stability of Intermediates
- Acidic nature of carboxylic acids
- Acid nature of phenols
- Bond length/ bond order comparison
- SIR/SIP effect
- Basic nature of amines
- Directes the attack in EAS reaction
