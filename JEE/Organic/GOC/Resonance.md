# Resonance
When two or more contributing structures of a compound can be drawn such
that none of the structures alone can explain all its properties then we draw an
average structure of all contributing structures called as “**Resonance Hybrid**”
and contributing structure are called as “**Resonating structures**” or “**canonical
structures**” and the phenomenon is called as “**Resonance**”.

### Points 
- __Resonating structures__ are unreal, **non-existing** structures because it
cannot be isolated or physically observed.
- Resonance hybrid is the nearest paper representation of actual molecule.
- **Resonance is a hypothetical** concept but it explains the observable
properties of molecules.

### Conditions for Resonance 
- System must be planar or nearly planar.
- System must be conjugated.

- According to resonance hypothesis hybridization of **an atom having Lone pair
cannot be $sp^{2}$, if it is directly attached to a multiple bonded atom**.

- Energy difference between various resonating structures must be very small.
**Interconversion energy barrier**:

### Rules for Resonance 
- Electron flow occurs from high electron density to low electron density.
- Atomic arrangement must be same in all resonating structures(RS)
- **Second period element should not violate the octet rule.**
- Number of unpaired $e^{-}$s must be same in all R.S.
- Lone pair can be convert into bond pair and vice-versa.
- Net charge should be conserved.
- Resonance contributors only differ by the positions of pi bond and lone
pair electrons.
- Sigma bonds are never broken or made, because of this atoms must
maintain their same position.

### Resonance Hybrid 
- Resonance hybrid(R.H) is more stable than resonating structures.
**Energy of most stable R.S - Energy of RH = Resonance energy**. 
- R.H is formed by contribution of all the R.S and is more stable than any
of these due to sharing.
- **Higher the R.Energy greater the stability of R.H.**
- Not all the R.S contributes equally to R.H more stable contributes more.
- Higher the number of contributing R.S greater the stability of that
species (absolute not relative).

### Stability of Resonating Structures
- **Not all R.S are equally stable.**
- Sequential rules to decide relative stability of R.S:
	- Higher no. of $\pi e^{-}$ in resonance $\rightarrow$ stability $\uparrow$
	- Non-polar or neutral molecule **>** polar or charged.
	- Polar with more no. of atoms with complete octet **>** polar with lesser no. of atoms with complete octet.
	- -ve charge on more E.N atom **>** -ve charge on lesser E.N atom and vice-versa for +ve charge.
	- Like charges should be away and unlike charges should be close to each other.
