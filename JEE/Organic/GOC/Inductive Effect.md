## Inductive Effect
Permanent polarization caused by displacement of $\sigma$ electrons along the
carbon chain.

### Points
- Destabilizing effect.
- Partial shift of o electrons, so partial charge develops.
- Effect decreases with distance, so it can be neglected after 3rd atom.
- Measured relative to hydrogen (considered to be zero).
- Inductive effect is of two types, +I and -I effects.
