title:Naming
Annulenes are named using a number in brackets that indicates the ring size
Benzene is [6] annulene and cyclooctatetraene is [8] annulene.
```
- Annulene is aromatic if it has (4n+2)$\pi e^{-}$ and a planar carbon skeleton.

 **Aromatic annulene**: [6] annulene and [18] annulene,
 **Non-aromatic annulene**: [8], [10] and [12] annulene.
 **Anti-aromatic**: cyclobutadiene or [4] annulene.
