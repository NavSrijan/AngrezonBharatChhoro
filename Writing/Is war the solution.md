Is war the solution?
Is war the solution?
People die, children suffer,
Women cry, soldiers martyred.
Leaders conquer, the turf
Which was never theirs.

Death toll, for us a number,
A dad, a son, a sister or a 
Dear family member.
Was this loss enough?
Will the family survive?
Or, do they need to sacrifice
Another child to thrive?

Is war the solution?
Ask the family of the dead.
One side wins, the other loses.
But will this win bring the aglow,
Did they really win?
The dead don't say so.
