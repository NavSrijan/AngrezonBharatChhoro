It is considered for an isolated system, the net [[JEE/Physics/Electrostatics/Charge]] of the system is always constant.
==[[JEE/Physics/Electrostatics/Charge]] can neither be created nor be destroyed and this is called '==<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Conservation of [[JEE/Physics/Electrostatics/Charge]]</mark>=='.==

> In a mechanical system, the [[JEE/Physics/Electrostatics/Charge]] on a body does not affect the inertial properties of the body. <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">[[JEE/Physics/Electrostatics/Charge]] does not depend on the reference frame</mark> from which a body and its different mechanical parameters are observed.
