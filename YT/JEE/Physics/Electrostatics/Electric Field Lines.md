# [[Electric Field Lines]] 
- A field line is a curve drawn in such a way that the tangent to it at each point is in the direction of the net field at that point.
- A field line is purely a geometric representation and has no physical existence.

- Two electric filed lines never intersect each other because, at the intersection point there will be two possible directions of electric field which is not possible.

- Number of field lines originating or terminating at a particular point is directly proportional to the magnitude of charge.
### Properties of Electric field lines
- In electrostatics condition, they cannot penetrate metallic surfaces.
- In electrostatics condition, they always (terminate at/originate from) metallic surfaces NORMALLY.

### Uniform Electric Field:
It is represented by set of parallel uniformly spaced lines.

### Non-Uniform Electric field
Non-uniform spaced lines and curved lines represent a non-uniform electric field.
