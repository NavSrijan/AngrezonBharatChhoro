# Depression in freezing point
> The freezing point of a substance may be defined as the temperature at which the [[Vapour Pressure]] of the substance in its liquid phase is equal to its [[Vapour Pressure]] in the solid phase.

The decrease in freezing point of solvent on addition of non-volative solute is known as _depression in freezing point($\Delta T_{f}$)_
